## What

Network traffic can go in many directions, and there are many jargony ways to refer to them. Let's define them.

**Ingress Traffic** is traffic that originates outside the local network that is transmitted to somewhere inside the local network. Remember ingress traffic is coming *in*.

**Egress Traffic** is traffic that originates inside the local network that is transmitted somewhere outside of the local network. Remember egress traffic is *e*xiting the local network.

```

               V                                ^
               |                                ^
               |                                |
+----------------------+         +----------------------+

| +-------+    |       |         | +-------+    |       |

| +-------+            |         | +-------+            |
+----------------------+         +----------------------+

```

**North/South** traffic is any communication between two different networks.  Both Ingress and Egress are examples of North/South traffic.

**East/West** traffic is any communication within one network.

## ‚ùìQuestions

How would you use ingress, egress, north/south, and east/west to describe the following situations:
- You visit neopets in your browser.
- Your pair `ssh`-es onto your computer.
- You set up a local netcat server and send traffic to it from your terminal.
