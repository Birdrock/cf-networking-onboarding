ðŸ‘‹  Welcome to CF Networking Onboarding! Before you dive into the curriculum
let's talk a little about what this onboarding _is_ and what it _isn't_.

### CF Networking Onboarding _is_...
...a self-paced, guided exploration of how CF Networking components are used,
implemented, and debugged. It is designed to make you think and experiment and
not just present the answers to you.

### CF Networking Onboarding _is not_...
...exhaustive document of every aspect of every networking feature for every IaaS.

### What are modules?
Modules are a collection of stories about a certain topic. This is the "Getting
Started" module!

The onboarding modules can be done in (almost) any order, but the stories in
each module are meant to be done in order. If you do them out of order you risk
not having the appropriate set up or context.

### What are stories?
Each module is made up of stories. The stories for each module are on the left
hand sidebar. You are currently in the "Introduction" story. Like it says
above, these stories are made to be done in order.

### Getting the most out of this onboarding
1. Take your time.
1. Read each story completely. You'll feel very silly if you struggle for hours
   with a problem that turns out to have been addressed in plain English....in
   a part of the story that you skipped.
1. If something in a story is missing / is wrong / could be improved, create an
   issue or a PR in the **[repo for this
   website](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-onboarding/tree/gh-pages)**.
1. Reach out in #cf-for-vms-networking in Cloud Foundry slack if you have any
   questions, comments, or just want to say hi.
