## Suggested Todo Checklist for Facilitator Prep

#### 6 Weeks Before
- [ ] Send out an open call for participants. See [the advertising training template](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-onboarding/blob/gh-pages/FACILITATION.md#advertising-once-a-date-is-decided). Post in relevant slack channels.
- [ ] If you do not feel comfortable leading the whitebaording sessions, find a faciliator (ask Amelia if you need help with this).
- [ ] Make a calendar invite booking the time for all participants. Add new ones as they confirm participation. See the [onboarding placeholder event template](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-onboarding/blob/gh-pages/FACILITATION.md#week-long-cf-networking-onboarding-event).

#### 3 Weeks Before
- [ ] Send out a reminder open call for participants. See [the advertising training template](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-onboarding/blob/gh-pages/FACILITATION.md#advertising-once-a-date-is-decided). Post in relevant slack channels.
- [ ] If another facilitator has been found for whiteboarding sessions, remind them of the commitment.

#### 1 Week Before
- [ ] Send out the welcome message in Slack. See [week before template](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-onboarding/blob/gh-pages/FACILITATION.md#welcoming-onborders-to-slack-channel-one-week-ahead-of-start).
- [ ] Make an 30 minute "welcome to onboarding" event for the week before the onboarding. This is time to make sure everyone is on the same page with expectations and to answer any questions. See [calendar invite template](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-onboarding/blob/gh-pages/FACILITATION.md#welcome-to-cf-networking-onboarding).
- [ ] Create dev environments.
- [ ] Make sure everyone is invited to the onboarding slack channel. Add yourself and any co-facilitators as interrupts.
- [ ] Send an agenda message in Slack. See the [onboarding agenda template](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-onboarding/blob/gh-pages/FACILITATION.md#events-for-onboarding-share-one-week-ahead).
- [ ] Create all remaining calendar invites. See [calendar invite templates](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-onboarding/blob/gh-pages/FACILITATION.md#calendar-invites) for each of these events.
  - [ ] Standup - 15 mins.
  - [ ] Routing Whiteboarding session on Tuesday - 1hr.
  - [ ] IPTables Presentation on Wednesday - 1hr.
  - [ ] C2C Whiteboarding session on Thursday - 1hr.
  - [ ] Retro on Friday. Retro board link: https://retro.bosh.team/retros/cf-networking-onboarding (password is in GCP as `retroboard-cf-networking-onboarding`
  - [ ] Feedback time on Friday. Block off 30 minutes for people to fill out the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4_cMKZh283_gM4T6BRkny9YXpLYhxrY9mP1tMv4y0SvkrGQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

#### 1 day before
- [ ] Double check on the workstations. If they have been recently reimaged, run a workstation script on them. I like the [Networking Workspace](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/networking-workspace). Let Amelia know if you need access to this repo.
- [ ] Claim + renew toolsmiths envs for participants, unless they have their own CF to use.
- Setup remote pairing hardware for remote participants (if applicable). Get headsets. Make sure zoom is downloaded.
