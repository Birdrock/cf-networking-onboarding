‚ú® Welcome to Gorouter the Code (TM) the Module (TM).

**WARNING: The "Gorouter the Code" stories are very new. ** You will probably find some typos. You will probably find some thi
ngs that aren't as clear as they could be.
Please open a [PR or an issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-onboarding/) when you find these problems. This is my first attempt at making stories that dive into the implementation of a component. Good luck! All feedback is a üéÅ and is very appreciated.

 * give you an understanding of what code is evaluated for each request/response
 * give you time and prompts to encourage you to look around gorouter code
 * get you more comfortable poking around the gorouter code
