Howdy folks! 

🌟**You're in!** If you're getting this email, it means that you have been chosen to participate in Networking Program Onboarding from ____________________.

🍐**So much to learn.** During the week you will be pairing full time with each other, working on stories, exploring actual user journeys and workflows that are central to the CF networking ecosystem.

📬**More communication to come.** There will be more communication closer to the start of Networking Program Onboarding, so don't worry too much about the details of preparation just yet. 

📅**Clear your calendars.** You will be pairing full time, however, so your teams should expect you to be away for the majority of the week. If you generally have a lot of meetings we recommend cancelling or moving as many of them as possible, but if you need to step out for a meeting here or there, that shouldn't be a problem.

👩‍💻**Pre-work.** There is about 2 hours worth of pre-work to complete before you start CF Networking Onboarding Week. You can find the pre-work [here](https://github.com/pivotal/cf-networking-program-onboarding/blob/master/templates/prework.md).

🙋‍♀️ **Interested in being a facilitator?** If you want to learn how to run these onboarding in the future, let me know and we can co-facilitate this one! 

Thanks!
The Networking Program Onboarding Staff
