Howdy folks!
If you're getting this email, it means that you're scheduled to participate in Networking Program Onboarding the week of __________________.

During the week you will be pairing full time with each other, working on stories exploring actual user journeys and workflows that are central to the CF networking ecosystem.

There will be more communication closer to the start of Networking Program Onboarding, so don't worry too much about the details of preparation just yet.  You will be pairing full time, however, so your teams should expect you to be away for the majority of the week. If you generally have a lot of meetings we recommend cancelling or moving as many of them as possible, but if you need to step out for a meeting here or there, that shouldn't be a problem.

If this week doesn't work for you, let us know!  

Thanks!
The Networking Program Onboarding Staff
