## Whiteboarding Session 1

It's time to review what you have learned about HTTP Routes. 

We will spend the hour working together to diagram the routing control plane and data plane.
You all will be leading this effort, with the help of your facilitator to keep you on track.

This is a great time to clarify anything you feel iffy on or to dig down and ask more questions.

Thank you so much for participating in CF Networking Onboarding week :) 

Please fill out this form to help me improve this onboarding in the future and show the value (or not) that it has for pivots.

The more detail the better. I know this might be a little repetitive with what we go over in retro, but it helps me to have this information written down in a quantitative way for me to present to directors. 

## Retro

Let's talk about how this week went. Bring your highs, your lows, your questions, and any other thoughts you may have.
