## What

The stories have been throwing around terms like IP, HTTP, DNS, DNAT without
talking about the broader networking context around these terms.

In this next track of work you will start looking at TCP as well. There are
some crucial differences between HTTP Routes and TCP Routes, that will make
more sense if you understand what layer of networking those different protocols
are on.

In this story you are going to learn about the OSI model (Open Systems
Interconnection model). In the OSI model, there are 7 networking layers and
each one is built on top of the one below it.
