## Facilitating Networking Program Onboarding Week

### Overview
Networking Program Onboarding Week exists to provide Networking Program engineers dedicated time to explore the networking components of Cloud Foundry in a self-paced learning environment.

Either way, the idea is to give people who want more experience with networking and routing in CF the space to work through common problems alongside someone who has the same questions as they do, coming away with knowledge drawn from figuring something out themselves (something that is often lacking when paired with an experienced dev).

Networking Program Onboarding Week is intended to be a **facilitated** experience. We want participants to get "productively lost" together, not wander in aimless hair-tearing frustration. 

### Suggested Todo checklist

#### 6 Weeks Before
- [ ] Send out an open call for participants. Email your office and post in relavent slack channels. Participants must have team, anchor, manager, and EL approval.

#### 4 Weeks Before
- [ ] Choose participants and let them know they have been choosen. See [welcome email template](/templates/welcome-email-template.md).
- [ ] Make a calendar event for the whole week and invite participants
- [ ] Make an 30 minute "welcome to onboarding" event for the week before the onboarding. This is time to make sure everyone is on the same page with expectations and to answer any questions. See [calendar invite template](/templates/calendar-invite-templates.md).
- [ ] Ask for workstations
- [ ] If you do not feel comfortable leading the whitebaording sessions, find a faciliator (ask Amelia if you need help with this).

#### 1 Week Before
- [ ] Send out reminder email. See [week before email template](/templates/week-before-email-template.md).
- [ ] Create and populate Tracker Project(s). Invite participants to all trackers.
- [ ] Create dev environments.
- [ ] Create pairist and populate with participants. 
- [ ] Create retro board.
- [ ] Create a slack channel and invite everyone. Add yourself and @ameowlia (if you want me, anyway) as interrupts.
- [ ] Post all relavent links in slack and let the participants know where and when to meet day 1. See [slack links template](/templates/slack-link-template.md).
- [ ] Create all calendar invites. See [calendar invite templates](/templates/calendar-invite-templates.md) for each of these events.
  - [ ] Hold standup every day. Make sure it's on the calenar, this way participants know when to start! This is especially important for the first day.
  - [ ] Whiteboarding sessions on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. These should be one hour long and make sure that you get a conference room with a good whiteboard (if you are not remote). If you are remote then set up a miro board.
  - [ ] Retro on Friday. Prepare the retro board ahead of time so participants can add items to it all week.
  - [ ] One team lunch. Make sure you get approval for budget.
  - [ ] Feedback time on Friday. Block off 30 minutes for people to fill out the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4_cMKZh283_gM4T6BRkny9YXpLYhxrY9mP1tMv4y0SvkrGQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

#### 1 day before
- [ ] Double check on the workstations. If they have been recently reimaged, run a workstation script on them. I like the [Networking Workspace](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/networking-workspace). Let Amelia know if you need access to this repo.
- [ ] Setup remote pairing hardware for remote participants (if applicable). Get headsets. Make sure zoom is downloaded.
