## Assumptions
- None

## What

Before you go further it will help if you read a quick primer on Envoy.

## How

1. 📚 Read Julia Evan's blog post ["Some Envoy Basics"](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/10/27/envoy-basics/).
 Unfortunately, the envoy in the docker container referenced in the blog post doesn't work anymore. However, just reading the post is enough to get a nice overview.
