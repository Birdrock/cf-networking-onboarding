## Recommended Reading Prior to Starting

Depending on your level of knowledge with networking, you may want to review the
[recommended reading](../recommended-reading)  about TCP, IP, UDP, DNS, and Containers.

## Start Here

Everyone should start by completing the stories in the Get Started Module.
These stories will teach you about how this onboarding works and will make sure
you have the correct environment.
* [Get Started](../get-started/intro)

## Continue Here

After you finish the Get Started Module, then it is your choice where to go
next. For the most part, the order your complete these modules doesn't matter.
When it does matter it is called out in the stories.
